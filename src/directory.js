/**
 * The peers this machine knows, and the ones it has merely heard of.
 *
 * Two sets, and the distinction between them is the security model rather than
 * bookkeeping:
 *
 * **Admitted** peers are ones a person added. They can be hailed, and this
 * machine will answer them.
 *
 * **Candidates** are names other peers mentioned. They are leads. Trust does
 * not travel with a peer list — a peer naming another tells you it exists, not
 * that you should talk to it. Admitting one stays a deliberate act, because
 * gossip that also carried trust would turn one compromised peer into a way to
 * introduce arbitrary machines.
 *
 * The directory holds no credentials, only names, routes and when each was last
 * seen. See `peerRecord`.
